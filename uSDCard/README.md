# MPMD_MARLIN_1.1.X

__an open-source upgrade for the Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer__

The [mpmd_marlin_1.1.x](https:/github.com/aegean-odyssey/mpmd_marlin_1.1.x)
project combines Marlin firmware 1.1.9 along with a few customizations to
create a useful open-source firmware for the printer. Use the files in this
zip archive to enhance your Monoprice MP Mini Delta 3d printer.

## Card Contents

* mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware

  The several variants of the mpmd_marlin_1.1.x firmware are now available
online. Please see [latest release](https://github.com/aegean-odyssey/mpmd_marlin_1.1.x/releases/latest)
to select and download your choice of firmware.
  
* G-code command files

  The setup_gcode folder contains a set of "command" (gcode) files
that extend the capabilities of the printer. Use the printer's
"print" function to perform calibrations, change or save settings,
and provide other capabilities that are normally not available on
the Monoprice Mini Delta printer.
